# PU5058-Visualisation_Mental_Health_Scores

Aberdeen University Assessment 

The assessment instructions were to choose data from https://www.scotpho.org.uk/comparative-health/profiles/online-profiles-tool or other health data of your choice
and to use visualisation to highlight the health issue. 

I choose mental health wellbeing scores for male and female students in S2 and S4 high school years. It was found that girls in S4 had the lowest mental health
wellbeing scores. A graph was used to highlight the differences.

I then investigated if the S4 girls scores were lowest in specific council areas in Scotland. This was highlighted using an interactive map.

Information about the data used and suggestions for improvements can be found in the written report in the Outputs folder.
